# AdaptiveControlLibrary

Matlab implementation of the Adaptive Control Library, see also [section 16 here](https://www.politesi.polimi.it/bitstream/10589/131993/3/RussoAlessio_AdaptiveControlMultirotorUAVs.pdf).

This is a collection of various operators commonly used in Model Reference Adaptive Control, from the thesis: `Alessio Russo, Adaptive control of multirotor UAVs, Polytechnic University of Milan, 2016`.

## Usage

Check the code in the `src` folder. The library can be found in the `adaptive_library.slx` file.
Other code includes the `l1norm` function, which can be used to compute the L1 norm of a linear system.
